# Orchidino Frontend

The Orchidino UI was created using React. This is my first attempt using react and this will be an evolution of libraries and components as I become more familiar

The UI in its current, basic, form consists of a chart of the collected environmental data which can be navigated using the scroll wheel to zoom and clicking/dragging to pan along the data set.
A data table of readings from the last 7 days is included for data review in tabluar form
Finally, an export to CSV button is included to allow the user to download the entire dataset. 

## To Do:
* Add zoom limit to chart
* Add bold formatting to major gridlines on x-axis
* Build out Data Table component
  * Add controls to adjust data view range
* Build out CSS
* Add live data components
* Any need for a React router?
* Add downlaod button for export to CSV

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
